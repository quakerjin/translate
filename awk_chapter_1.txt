$ awk '$3 == 0 { print $1 } 
Beth	4.00	0 
Beth 
Dan	3.75	0
Dan 
Kathy	3.75	10 
Kathy	3.75	0 
Kathy
...

The heavy characters are what the computer printed. 

This behavior makes it easy to experiment with awk: type your program,then type data at it and see what happens. We again encourage you to try the examples and variations on them.

Notice that the program is enclosed in single quotes on the command line. This protects characters like $ in the program from being interpreted by the shell and also allows the program to be longer than one line.

This arrangement is convenient when the program is short (a few lines). If the program is long, however, it is more convenient to put it into a separate file, say progfile, and type the command line.
	awk -f progfile	optional list of input files 

The -f option instructs awk to fetch the program from the named file. Any filename can be used in place of progfile.


Errors

If you make an error in an awk program, awk will give you a diagnostic
message. For example, if you mistype a brace, like this: 

	awk '$3 == 0 [ print $1 }' emp.data

you will get a message like this:
	awk: syntax error at source line 1 
	context is
		$3==0>>> [<<< 
		extra } 
		missing  ]
	awk: bailing out at source line 1

"Syntax error" means that you have made a grammatical error that was detected at the place marked by >>> <<<. "Bailing out" means that no recovery was attempted. Sometimes you get a little more help about what the error was, such as a report of mismatched braces or parentheses.

Because of the syntax error, awk did not try to execute this program. Some errors, however, may not be detected until your program is running. For example, if you attempt to divide a number by zero, awk will stop its processing and report the input line number and the line number in the program at which the division was attempted.

============================================

1.2	Simple Output

The rest of this chapter contains a collection of short, typical awk programs based on manipulation of the emp.data file above. We'll explain briefly what's going on, but these examples are meant mainly to suggest useful operations that are easy to do with awk - printing fields, selecting input, and transforming data. We are not showing everything that awk can do by any means, nor are we going into many details about the specific things presented here. But by the end of this chapter, you will be able to accomplish quite a bit, and you'll find it much easier to read the later chapters.

We will usually show just the program, not the whole command line. In every case, the program can be run either by enclosing it in quotes as the first argument of the awk command, as shown above, or by putting it in a file and invoking awk on that file with the - f option.

There are only two types of data in awk: numbers and strings of characters. The emp.data file is typical of this kind of information - a mixture of words and numbers separated by blanks and/or tabs.

Awk reads its input one line at a time and splits each line into fields, where, by default, a field is a sequence of characters that doesn't contain any blanks or tabs. The first field in the current input line is called $1, the second $2, and so forth. The entire line is called $0. The number of fields can vary from line to line.

Often, all we need to do is print some or all of the fields of each line, perhaps performing some calculations. The programs in this section are all of that form.

Printing Every Line

If an action has no pattern, the action is performed for all input lines. The statement print by itself prints the current input line, so the program

	{ print }

prints all of its input on the standard output. Since $0 is the whole line, 

	{ print $0 }

does the same thing.

Printing Certain Fields

More than one item can be printed on the same output line with a single print statement.The program to print the first and third fields	of each	input line is

	{ print $1, $3 } 

With emp.data as input, it produces

======================

	Beth 0
	Dan 0
	Kathy 10
	Mark 20
	Mary 22
	Susie 18

Expressions separated by a comma in a print statementare , by default, separated by a single blank when they are printed. Each line produced by print ends with a newline character. Both of these defaults can be changed; we'll show how in Chapter 2.

NF, the Number of Fields

It might appear you must always refer to fields as $1, $2, and so on, but any expression can be used after $ to denote a field number; the expression is evaluated and its numeric value is used as the field number. Awk counts the number of fields in the current input line and stores the count in a built-in vari- able called NF. Thus, the program

	{ print NF, $1, $NF } 

prints the number of fields and the first and last fields of each input line.

Computing and Printing

You can also do computations on the field values and include the results in what is printed. The program

	{ print $1, $2 * $3 } 

is a typical example. It prints the name and total pay (rate times hours) for
each employee:

	Beth 0 
	Dan 0 
	Kathy 40 
	Mark 100 
	Mary 121 
	Susie 76.5

We'll show in a moment how to make this output look better.

Printing Line Numbers

Awk provides another built-variable, called NR, that counts the number of lines read so far. We can use NR and $0 to prefix each line of emp.data with its line number:

	{ print NR, $0 } 

The output looks like this:

	1 Beth	4.00	0
	2 Dan	3.75	0
	3 Kathy	4.00	10
	4 Mark	5.00	20
	5 Mary	5.50	22
	6 Susie	4.25	18

==================

Putting Text in the Output

You can also print words in the midst of fields and computed values: 

	{ print "total pay for", $1, "is", $2 * $3 }

prints

	total pay for Beth is 0 
	total pay for Dan is 0 
	total pay for Kathy is 40 
	total pay for Mark is 100 
	total pay for Mary is 121 
	total pay for Susie is 76.5

In the print statement, the text inside the double quotes is printed along with the fields and computed values.

1.3	Fancier Output

The print statement is meant for quick and easy output. To format the output exactly the way you want it, you may have to use the printf statement. As we shall	see in Section 2.4, printf can produce almost any kind of output, but in this section we'll only show a few of its capabilities.

Lining Up Fields

The printf statement has the form 

	printf(format, value1, value2, ••• , valueN,)

where format is a string that contains text to be printed verbatim, interspersed with specifications of how each of the values is to be printed. A specification is a % followed by a few characters that control the format of a value. The first specification tells how value1 is to be printed, the second how value2 is to be printed, and so on. Thus, there must be as many % specifications in format as values to be printed.

Here's a program that uses printf to print the total pay for every employee:

	{ printf("total pay for %s is $%.2f\n", $1, $2 * $3) } 

The specification string in the printf statement contains two %specifications.

=========================

The first, %s, says to print the first value, $1, as a string of characters; the second, %. 2f, says to print the second value, $2*$3, as a number with 2 digits after the decimal point. Everything else in the specification string, including the dollar sign, is printed verbatim; the \n at the end of the string stands for a new line, which causes subsequent output to begin on the next line. With emp. data as input, this program yields:


	total pay for Beth is $0.00 
	total pay for Dan is $0.00 
	total pay for Kathy is $40.00 
	total pay for Mark is $100.00 
	total pay for Mary is $121.00 
	total pay for Susie is $76.50

With printf, no blanks or newlines are produced automatically; you must create them yourself. Don't forget the \n.

Here's another program that prints each employee's name and pay: 

	{ printf("%-8s $%6.2f\n", $1, $2 * $3) }

The first specification, %-8s, prints a name as a string of characters left justified in a field 8 characters wide. The second specification, %6. 2f, prints the pay as a number with two digits after the decimal point, in a field 6 characters wide:

	Beth	$ 0.00 
	Dan	$ 0.00 
	Kathy	$ 40.00 
	Mark	$100.00 
	Mary	$121.00 
	Susie	$ 76.50

We'll show lots more examples of printf as we go along; the full story is in Section 2.4.

Sorting the Output

Suppose you want to print all the data for each employee, along with his or her pay, sorted in order of increasing pay. The easiest way is to use awk to pre- fix the total pay to each employee record, and run that output through a sorting program. On Unix, the command line

	awk '{ printf("%6.2f %s\n", $2 * $3, $0) }' emp.data | sort 

pipes the output of awk into the sort command, and produces:

===========================

0.00    Beth 4.00 0 
0.00    Dan 3.75 0 
40.00   Kathy 4.00 10 
76.50   Susie 4.25 18 
100.00  Mark 5.00 20 
121.00  Mary 5.50 22

1.4 Selection

Awk patterns are good for selecting interesting lines from the input for further processing. Since a pattern without an action prints all lines matching the pattern, many awk programs consist of nothing more than a single pattern. This section gives some examples of useful patterns.

Selection by Comparison

This program uses a comparison pattern to select the records of employees who earn $5.00 or more per hour, that is, lines in which the second field is greater than or equal to 5:

	$2 >= 5 

It selects these lines from emp.data:

	Mark	5.00	20 
	Mary	5.50	22

Selection by Computation 

The program

	$2 * $3 > 50 { printf("$%.2f for %s\n", $2 * $3, $1) } 

prints the pay of those employees whose total pay exceeds $50:

	$100.00 for Mark 
	$121.00 for Mary 
	$76.50 for Susie

Selection by Text Content 

Besides numeric tests, you can select input lines that contain specific words
or phrases. This program prints all lines in which the first field is Susie: 

	$1 == "Susie"

The operator == tests for equality. You can also look for text containing any of a set of letters, words, and phrases by using patterns called regular expressions. This program prints all lines that contain Susie anywhere:

==================

/Susie/ 

The output is this line:

	Susie	4.25	18

Regular expressions can be used to specify much more elaborate patterns; Section 2.1 contains a full discussion.

Combinations of Patterns

Patterns can be combined with parentheses and the logical operators &&, || ,
and !, which stand for AND, OR, and NOT. The program 

	$2 >= 4 || $3 >= 20

prints those lines where $2 is at least 4 or $3 is at least 20:

	Beth	4.00	0 
	Kathy	4.00	10 
	Mark	5.00	20 
	Mary	5.50	22 
	Susie	4.25	18

Lines that satisfy both conditions are printed only once. Contrast this with the following program, which consists of two patterns:

	$2 >= 4 
	$3 >= 20

This program prints an input line twice if it satisfies both conditions:

	Beth	4.00	0 
	Kathy	4.00	10 
	Mark	5.00	20 
	Mark	5.00	20 
	Mary	5.50	22 
	Mary	5.50	22 
	Susie	4.25	18

Note that the program 

	!($2 < 4 && $3 < 20)

prints lines where it is not true that $2 is less than 4 and $3 is less than 20; this condition is equivalent to the first one above, though perhaps less readable.

Data Validation

There are always errors in real data. Awk is an excellent tool for checking that data has reasonable values and is in the right format, a task that is often called data validation.

Data validation is essentially negative: instead of printing lines with desirable properties, one prints lines that are suspicious. The following program uses

================

comparison patterns to apply five plausibility tests to each line of emp. data:

	NF != 3   { print $0, "number of fields is not equal to 3" }
	$2 < 3.35 { print $0, "rate is below minimum wage" } 
	$2 > 10   { print $0, "rate exceeds $10 per hour" }
	$3 < 0    { print $0, "negative hours worked" }
	$3 > 60   { print $0, "too many hours worked" }

If there are no errors, there's no output.

BEGIN and END

The special pattern BEGIN matches before the first line of the first input ·file is read, and END matches after the last line of the last file has been processed. This program uses BEGIN to print a heading:

	BEGIN { print "NAME RATE HOURS"; print "" } 
	{ print }

The output is: 

	NAME  RATE  HOURS

	Beth  4.00   0 
        Dan   3.75   0 
	Kathy 4.00   10 
	Mark  5.00   20 
	Mary  5.50   22 
	Susie 4.25   18
You can put several statements on a single line if you separate them by semicolons. Notice that print "" prints a blank line, quite different from just plain print, which prints the current input line.

1.5	Computing with AWK

An action is a sequence of statements separated by newlines or semicolons. You have already seen examples in which the action was a single print statement. This section provides examples of statements for performing simple numeric and string computations. In these statements you can use not only the built-in variables like NF, but you can create your own variables for performing calculations, storing data, and the like. In awk, user-created variables are not declared.

Counting

This program uses a variable emp to count employees who have worked more than 15 hours:

==========

	$3> 15{emp=emp+1} 
	END	{ print emp, "employees worked more than 15 hours" }

For every line in which the third field exceeds 15, the previous value of emp is incremented by 1. With emp.data as input, this program yields:

	3 employees worked more than 15 hours 

Awk variables used as numbers begin life with the value 0, so we didn't need to
initialize emp. 

Computing Sums and Averages

To count the number of employees, we can use the built-in variable NR, which holds the number of lines read so far; its value at the end of all input is the total number of lines read.

	END { print NR, "employees" } 

The output is:

	6 employees 

Here is a program that uses NR to compute the average pay:

	{ pay =pay + $2 * $3 } 
	END { print NR, "employees"
	      print "total pay is", pay 
              print "average pay is", pay/NR
            }

The first action accumulates the total pay for all employees. The END action prints

	6 employees 
	total pay is 337.5 
	average pay is 56.25

Clearly,printf could be	used to	produce	neater output.	There's	also a potential error: in the unlikely case that NR is zero, the program will attempt to divide by zero and thus will generate an error message.

Handling Text

One of the strengths of awk is its ability to handle strings of characters as conveniently as most languages handle numbers. Awk variables can hold strings of characters as well as numbers. This program finds the employee who is paid the most per hour:

	$2 > maxrate { maxrate =$2; maxemp =$1 } 
	END { print "highest hourly rate:", maxrate, "for", maxemp }

It prints

=========

	highest hourly rate: 5.50 for Mary

In this program the variable maxrate holds a numeric value, while the variable maxemp holds a string. (If there are several employees who all make the same maximum pay, this program finds only the first.}

String Concatenation

New strings may be created by combining old ones; this operation is called concatenation. The program

	{ names = names $1 " " } 
	END { print names }

collects all the employee names into a single string, by appending each name and a blank to the previous value in the variable names. The value of names is printed by the END action:

	Beth Dan Kathy Mark Mary Susie

The concatenation operation is represented in an awk program by writing string values one after the other. At every input line, the first statement in the program concatenates three strings: the previous value of names, the first field, and a blank; it then assigns the resulting string to names. Thus, after all input lines have been read, names contains a single string consisting of the names of all the employees, each followed by a blank. Variables used to store strings begin life holding the null string (that is, the string containing no characters), so in this program names did not need to be explicitly initialized.

Printing the Last Input Line

Although NR retains its value in an END action, $0 does not. The program 

	{ last = $0 }
	END { print last } 

is one way to print the last input line:

	Susie	4.25	18 

Built-in Functions

We have already seen that awk provides built-in variables that maintain frequently used quantities like the number of fields and the input line number. Similarly, there are built-in functions for computing other useful values. Besides arithmetic functions for square roots, logarithms, random numbers, and the like, there are also functions that manipulate text. One of these is length, which counts the number of characters in a string. For example, this program computes the length of each person's name:

===============

	{ print $1, length($1) } 

The result:

	Beth 4 
	Dan 3 
	Kathy 5 
	Mark 4 
	Mary 4 
	Susie 5

Counting Lines, Words, and Characters

This program uses length, NF, and NR to count the number of lines, words, and characters in the input. For convenience, we'll treat each field as a word.

	{ nc =nc + length($0) + 1 
	  nw =nw + NF
        }
   END	{ print NR, "lines," nw, "words,", nc, "Characters" } 

The file emp.data has

	6 lines, 18 words, 77 characters

We have added one for the newline character at the end of each input line, since $0 doesn't include it.

1.6 Control-Flow Statements

Awk provides an if-else statement for making decisions and several statements for writing loops, all modeled on those found in the C programming language. They can only be used in actions.

If-Else Statement

The following program computes the total and average pay of employees making more than $6.00 an hour. It uses an if to defend against division by zero in computing the average pay.

	$2 > 6 { n =n + 1; pay =pay + $2 * $3} 
	END    { if (n > 0)
		     print n, "employees, total pay is" , pay, 
                              "average pay is" , pay/n
		 else 
		     print "no employees are paid more than $6/hour"
               }

The output for emp. data is:

=============

	no employees are paid more than $6/hour

In the if - else statement, the	condition following the	if is evaluated. If it is true,	the first print	statement is performed.	Otherwise, the second print statement is performed. Note that we can continue a long statement over several lines by breaking it after a comma.

While Statement

A while	statement has a	condition and a	body. The statements in	the body are performed repeatedly while the condition is true. This program shows how the value of an amount of money invested at a particular interest rate grows over a number of years, using the formula value = amount (1 +rate)years.

	# interest1 - compute compound interest 
	#    input: amount rate years 
	#    output: compounded value at the end of each year
	{ i=1 
	  while (i <= $3) {
	      printf("\t%.2f\n", $1 * (1 + $2) ^i) 
              i=i+1
          }
	} 
 
The condition is the parenthesized expression after the while; the loop body is the two statements enclosed in braces after the condition. The \t in the printf specification string stands for a tab character; the ^ is the exponentiation operator. Text from a # to the end of the line is a comment, which is ignored by awk but should be helpful to readers of the program who want to understand what is going on.

You can type triplets of numbers at this program to see what various amounts, rates, and years produce. For example, this transaction shows how $1000 grows at 6% and 12% compound interest for five years:

	$ awk -f interest1 
	1000 .06 5
		1060.00 
		1123.60 
		1191.02 
		1262.48 
		1338.23
	1000 .12 5 
		1120.00
		1254.40 
		1404.93 
		1573.52 
		1762.34

===========================

For Statement

Another statement, for, compresses into a single line the initialization, test, and increment that are part of most loops. Here is the previous interest computation with a for:

	# interest2 - compute compound interest
	# input: amount rate years
	# output: compounded value at the end of each year

	{for (i = 1; i <= $3; i = i + 1)
		 printf("\t%.2f\n", $1 * (1 + $2) ^ i)

  	}

The initialization i = 1 is performed once. Next, the condition i <= $3 is tested; if it is true, the printf statement, which is the body of the loop, is performed. Then the increment i = i + 1 is performed after the body, and the next iteration of the loop begins with another test of the condition. The code is more compact, and since the body of the loop is only a single statement, no braces are needed to enclose it.

1.7 Arrays

Awk provides arrays for storing groups of related values. Although arrays give awk considerable power, we will show only a simple example here. The following program prints its input in reverse order by line. The first action puts the input lines into successive elements of the array line; that is, the first line goes into 1ine[1], the second line into 1ine[2], and so on. The END action uses a while statement to print the lines from the array from last to first:

	# reverse - print input in reverse order by line 
		{line[NR] = $0 } # remember each input line

	END { i = NR # print lines in reverse order 
	      while (i > 0) {
		print line[i]
		i=i-1
               }
            }

With emp. data, the output is

	Susie 4.25 18 
	Mary 5.50 22 
	Mark 5.00 20 
	Kathy 4.00 10 
	Dan 3.75 0 
	Beth 4.00 0

================

Here is the same example with a for statement:

	# reverse - print input in reverse order by line
		{ line[NR] =$0 } # remember each input line

	END { for (i =NR; i > 0; i =i - 1) 
		print line[i]
	     }


1.8 A Handful of Useful "One-liners"

Although awk can be used to write programs of some complexity, many useful programs are not much more complicated than what we've seen so far. Here is a collection of short programs that you might find handy and/or instructive. Most are variations on material already covered.

	1. Print the total number of input lines: 

		END { print NR }

	2. Print the tenth input line: 

		NR == 10

3. Print the last field of every input line: 

		{ print $NF }

4. Print the last field of the last input line:
	
		{ field = $NF} 
		END { print field }

5. Print every input line with more than four fields: 

		NF > 4

6. Print every input line in which the last field is more than 4: 

		$NF > 4
7. Print the total number of fields in all input lines:

		{ nf = nf + NF } END { print nf }

8. Print the total number of lines that contain Beth:

		/Beth/ { nlines =nlines + 1 } 

		END { print nlines }
